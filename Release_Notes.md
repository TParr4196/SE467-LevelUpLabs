### üöÄ Overview
Brief description of the goals or focus of this release.

### ‚úÖ New Features
- Feature 1: User's game collection tab.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
- Issue 1: The user's id, and friends id, as well as available games by their ids are hard coded. In the furture, the user's id will be based on the logged in user. Their friends list will need to be tracked on the backened where its dynamically populated. The games allowed to select will show all games in the backened dynamically, which will require a new API endpoint to get all gamesId/gameNames. 
- Issue 2: Currently sending a collection to another user doesn't do anything, as the system does not currently have connections between users. The system will need to send messages back and forth to one another.
- Issue 3: When toggling the slider for setting the application to private or not, it doesn't really do anything currently. Functionality of setting the profile to private needs to be added.
